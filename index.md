GRYD Technologies was formed in 2016 with the collaboration of four undergraduates during a semester project. Since then, we have evolved into a software development company. Our current focus is on research in the area of distributed computing, and are in the process of developing a microservices framework that simply 'works' across all scales of enterprises.
