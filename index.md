We are a team of Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduates from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, aspiring to bring innovative ideas to life.

GRYD Technology was formed in 2016 with the collaboration of four undergraduates during a semester project. Since then, we have evolved into a software development company. Our current focus is on research in the area of distributed computing, and are in the process of developing a microservices framework that simply 'works' across all scales of enterprises.
